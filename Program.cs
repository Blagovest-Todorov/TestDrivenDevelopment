            // what the user will input, waht will be the output.
            //

            // The standard approach --DevelopCode first-->  then  write the unit Test, Run and succed.
            // i e, code and tehn test approach !
            // clean tests---Tests on the code -tests are expected to work !
            // dirty tests- >  test that we read, and we expect they to brak the code, to find a bug !
            // in a Big project , the dirty tests muss be more  than the clean test!
            // Clean tests--tehy chweck the normal behaviour of the method.
            // if we write the unit test with intention to break the code, then we will have more success.
            // If we write the unit test with thte conseption to prove that out code works, we will have less success
            // unit tests must find bugs ! must show the defects, unittest pays off lot !
            // Test Driven development- helps to find design -Problems early with our code !
